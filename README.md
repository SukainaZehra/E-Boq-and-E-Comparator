BOQ i.e Bill of quantities is a document used in tendering in the construction industry in which materials, parts, and labor (and their costs) are itemized.
The purpose of this porject is to digitize the old traditional format of BOQs to a completely paperless web forms.
There are 2 stakeholders in the project:
1. A user who can fill the web based BOQ by browsing to https://fnd1234.000webhostapp.com/ 
2. An admin who can view, download and manage all submissions by different clients and can also generate a Technical comparator based on the responses at https://fnd1234.000webhostapp.com/adminlogin.php

E-BOQ:   
1. Only authorize user can access the e-boq via Login form.
2. Sample user id and pwd: siemens1
3. A user can partially fill the boq and save it as draft for later use (however the draft won't be saved with zero fields filled)
4. User can submit the boq only when all entries are fully filled.
5. Each user can submit boq for one and only one time. Therefore, it is requested to rather save boq as Draft and recheck all the fields before making final submission.

E-COMPARATOR:  
1. Only authorize admin can access the e-comparator via Login form.
2. Sample admin id and pwd: admin1
3. Admin can view the status and submitted response of all users (in this case, there are total 3 users)
4. If a user has submitted boq, the status of the user will be marked as 'Submitted' in the admin panel and his submitted boq form will be visible to admin.
5. Admin can also download user's submitted boq form.
6. If 2 out of 3 users submit the boq, admin will be able to generate Technical comparator which will compare all the user responses.
